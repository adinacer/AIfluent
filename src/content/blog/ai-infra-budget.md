# AI Infra on a Budget – What You Really Need

Building AI applications doesn't have to be expensive. In this guide, we'll explore the essential infrastructure components you need to run AI applications efficiently while keeping costs under control.

## Essential Components

Here's what you really need to get started:

1. **Compute Resources**

   - CPU for preprocessing
   - GPU for model inference (when needed)
   - Memory for data handling

2. **Storage**

   - Object storage for models
   - Database for application data
   - Cache layer for performance

3. **Networking**
   - CDN for static assets
   - Load balancer for traffic
   - API gateway for security

## Cost-Effective Solutions

### Compute Options

```yaml
# Example infrastructure as code
resources:
  - name: inference-server
    type: gcp-compute-instance
    machine_type: e2-standard-4
    spot: true # Use spot instances for cost savings
    preemptible: true
```

### Storage Solutions

1. **Object Storage**

   - Use S3-compatible storage
   - Implement lifecycle policies
   - Enable compression

2. **Database**
   - Start with managed services
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement caching

## Optimization Strategies

1. **Resource Scaling**

   - Auto-scaling based on demand
   - Spot instances for non-critical workloads
   - Container orchestration for efficiency

2. **Cost Monitoring**
   - Set up budget alerts
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Implement cost allocation

## Security Considerations

Even on a budget, don't compromise on security:

- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Regular security updates
- Basic monitoring and logging

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Essential monitoring tools:

1. **Application Monitoring**

   - Error tracking
   - Performance metrics
   - User analytics

2. **Infrastructure Monitoring**
   - Resource utilization
   - Cost tracking
   - Health checks

## Conclusion

Building AI infrastructure on a budget is possible with the right approach. Focus on essential components, use cost-effective solutions, and implement proper monitoring from the start.

Remember: Start small, monitor costs, and scale as needed. Stay tuned for more cost optimization tips!
